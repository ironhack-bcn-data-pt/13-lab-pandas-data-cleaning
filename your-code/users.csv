6,584622,David Wallis,"<p>I'm a self taught programmer. </p>

<p>I first learned to program on an 8-bit Acorn Atom in the early 80s. Unlike most people of my age at that time (early teens) I didn't play games on my computer. I learned BASIC and 6502 assembler and wrote stuff. I wrote simple compilers for languages I'd invented. When my Atom broke I borrowed one from the shop I bought it from, and this Atom had a 6522 VIA chip that gave me interrupts. So over the weekend I had it, I wrote a pre-emptive task switcher to multi-task programs that I'd written on my own languages and compiled with my crude compilers. I had no idea this was what I'd written. I just thought it would be cool to have several programs running at the same time like on big mainframes.</p>

<p>Later on I did a physics degree and worked as a software engineer doing industrial serial comms.</p>

<p>Then I did a PhD (Modelling hypervelocity impact crater morphology with orthogonal polynomials), worked as a postdoc for a few years, and wrote modelling and data-processing software.</p>

<p>Now, after a bit of bad health and a change of plan, I work as a motorcycle instructor, study countryside and wildlife management at college, and program for fun.</p>

<p>I've started to get into some new languages - common lisp, scheme, and now haskell. My interest seems to be growing towards implementing languages. I've written a little forth implementation, and I'm starting to think up some new language ideas.</p>

<p>I'll probably end up spending ludicrous amounts of time writing something like an operating system or compiler that's of no practical use whatsoever. But it's fun. Back to the Atom days.</p>",,2011-01-21 15:15:48.463000+00:00,2020-05-28 09:07:58.687000+00:00,United Kingdom,510,14,0,37,,

60,1864489,Richard Griffiths,"<p>At 33 years old, I began coding to help me with my day job as it became more and more helpful. Whee I left the role, I was an advanced beginner with a basic grasp of OOP and functional coding skills. My languages were VB, SQL and F#.</p>

<p>I left, took time away from computers for about a year. When I restarted I completed a Coursera qualification in R programming. 
My first proper junior developer role started in November 2015 and it involved: Oracle and SQL Server databases, legacy coding and updating in VB/C#. </p>

<p>During this role, I used a lot of stored procs, dynamic sql and queries from sql server to oracle including the use of the dreaded curser.</p>

<p>Current skills:</p>

<p>VB, C#, F#
Metaprogramming using T4 templating (I modified ReversePoco, a C# project to allow me to use it in VB)
T-SQL, Oracle
R
ASP.net webforms, with enough HTML, CSS, Twitter Bootstrap etc to get into trouble.
Addition, I've used T4 templating, plenty of LINQ, entity framework, WPF in addition to Winforms, F# type providers and written a generic dynamic rules engine that generates a list of lambda predicates using expression trees in VB.</p>

<p>I've an increasing interest in machine learning and AI. Currently I'm learning the basics of neural networks with a view to implementing a fractal one that is a neural net composed of neural nets. Part of this is investigating whether a genetic algorithm can be used by the higher levels of the NN to spawn neural net nodes on demand. May be a rather tall, naive order but that's ok; setting out to find out if it's possible will no doubt lead to interesting skill sets regardless.</p>

<p>I don't think people should have to just adapt to software. I don't think software can be quickly made to adapt to people either but I do think there is a solid balance to be struck and it should be biased towards the people NOT the implementation.</p>",,2012-11-29 20:45:33.040000+00:00,2020-05-28 09:06:35.563000+00:00,United Kingdom,560,196,3,190,https://i.stack.imgur.com/rikEY.jpg?s=128&g=1,http://www.richardkg.com

I love Java, looking into JavaScript, web Dev, C# and many more.<br>
<strong>Photoshop</strong> (my user interface designs are born in PS), <strong>After Effect</strong> (is also on the list but haven't had much exposure)... <strong>Sony Vegas</strong> (not very popular but I love it) and many more!</p>

<p><strong>How long I've been into this</strong><br>
In 2014, I created my first project for my business class (someone almost took away all my credit for the work... but it came back to me). Since then, I moved onto <strong>Computer Science</strong> course and development my skills/knowledge/experience further from there.</p>

<p><strong>Why programming</strong><br>
I simply love solving problems and enjoy watching few lines of code build something interesting. Also I hope to build or be part of the next big thing which will impact the lives of the users! + I am also trying to build something for other developers to use and learn from as I want to contribute to the development community. </p>

<p>I've been a developer for over 30 years at all levels from junior developer to team lead and project manager. I learnt Pascal at University and my first job was programming in FORTRAN 66. I've since moved to Silverlight with C# & .NET via Ada, C and C++ and a bit of ASP.NET. I've worked at companies varying in size from a five person startup to a multinational games company.</p>

<p>Over the years I've used most operating systems (apart from MacOS/iOS!), starting with PR1MOS and then moving onto various flavours of Unix. I'm now exclusively on Windows, but really should get back into other areas. The only things that are holding me back are lack of time and resources!</p>",,2009-01-27 11:28:18.780000+00:00,2020-05-30 22:40:16.997000+00:00,United Kingdom,122358,2544,727,28044,https://i.stack.imgur.com/gIt1g.png?s=128&g=1,

516,425254,NickM,"<p>I am a photographer based in Watford and have been taking pictures for over 20 years. My interest in photography stretches back to my schooldays, when a friend started demonstrating what he could do with his Praktica SLR. I soon got my own as a Christmas present, and have never looked back. </p>

<p>Closely linked to my technical background is my fascination with patterns, both natural and man-made, and I love creating photographs where the two interact. I am also keenly aware of colour and light, both in their presence and their absence, and the differences between how a camera sees the everyday world and how the human eye does.</p>

<p>As a photographer, the works I create can only ever be recordings of things already in existence or created by others; however by applying my eye for a detail here, or a pattern there, I hope to be able to show people the most common everyday object in a new light.</p>",,2010-08-19 13:03:55.400000+00:00,2020-01-10 13:21:21.200000+00:00,United Kingdom,263,5,1,20,https://i.stack.imgur.com/B9QBf.png,http://nickminers.com

991,656172,Lea Hayes,"<p>I have been fascinated by software and video games since a young age when I was given my first computer, a Dragon 32. Since then I have experimented with numerous methods of development ranging from point-and-click type packages to C++. I soon realized that software development was what I wanted to do.</p>

<p>Having invested a lot of time into programming with various languages and technologies I now find it quite easy to pickup new ideas and methodologies. I relish learning new ideas and concepts.</p>

<p>Throughout my life I have dabbled in game and engine development. I was awarded a first for the degree ""BEng Games and Entertainment Systems Software Engineering"" at the University of Greenwich. It was good to finally experience video games from a more professional perspective.</p>

<p>Due to various family difficulties I was unable to immediately pursue any sort of software development career. This didn't stop me from dabbling though!</p>

<p>Since then I formed a company to focus upon client projects. Up until now the company has primarily dealt with website design and development. I have since decided that it would be fun to go back to my roots and develop games and tools that other developers can use for their games.</p>

<p>We have recently released our first game on iPhone/iPad called ""Munchy Bunny!"" (see: <a href=""http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/munchy-bunny!/id516575993?mt=8"" rel=""nofollow"">View in app store</a>). We hope to expand the game and release to additional platforms.</p>

<p>I've always enjoyed being closer to the metal. My favourite programming language--by quite a margin--is C. It's not always the best choice when starting a new project, actually it's rarely a good first choice for anything these days, but at least in the realm of game programming it feels like I'm not just using it out of stubbornness.</p>

<p>I enjoy programming. It's fun. I also enjoy reading, listening to music at volumes much too high to be healthy, and walking.

Talking to former clients of the leading contenders for your job can help you make the very best choice. If you get glowing references from satisfied clients, you can hire the local plumbing service provider with confidence that all should go well with your project. If you are still not convinced, check the internet for online reviews about the local plumbing service provider. </p>

<p>Even though it's considered out-of-date by some, the local telephone book continues to be a great tool to use in order to find many reliable plumbing repair contractors. Choose the contractors that look promising so you can research their residential and commercial plumbing company or set up an interview. Always include complete financial details and a payment schedule in written contracts. Messy job sites can be dangerous for you and for the staff, so feel free to require a tidy and neat area from the plumbing service provider for your project. </p>

<p>The downside was when I tried to get some ""Computer Qualifications"" I found I would have to start at a level that was way below my experience...In short I was too old to tolerate sitting in a classroom learning stuff I already knew to justify the cost of the course.</p>

2611,2378711,almo,"<p>With wide experience in R&amp;D+i at Telecommunication and Software Engineering sector, I have been always working developing, transferring and promoting innovative technologies. Also I have been founder in a couple of non fully successful startups. Starting on April 2013, I am glad to be part of Developer Relations team at Google.</p>

<p>From an educational point of view, I have completed a master degree in Computer Science. Nonetheless I have been keeping an eye on continuous education, with additional training courses in project management, ITIL or entrepreneurship. Particularly I am extending my skills on business &amp; management, attending a part time bachelor in Business Administration.</p>

<p>From a career point of view, I have been working in most of the stages of R&amp;D+i, including software development, project management (medium size projects), product definition, marketing and business development at several R&amp;D departments of Telecommunications and Software Engineering industries. I always spent some time as associated professor in a Computer Science School, teaching distributed operating system (Plan9, Inferno, Linux), embedded system &amp; robotic (BrickOS, ROS) and programing (ADA, C, Java, Limbo).</p>

<p>During all this time, I have been focusing in open innovation strategies and planning and deployment of innovation projects, deeply related with Open Source paradigms and technologies, where developer’s communities &amp; 3rd parties play an important role. In particular, last five years I have been designing strategies, aiming university students and SMEs, to engage developers on new technologies.</p>

<p>Geographically, as part of my activities I have been creating partnership with enterprises, big industrial association, developers communities and universities in Spain, Argentina, Colombia, Brazil, Mexico and Chile but also Canada, USA, Europe and Israel.</p>

<p>Finally, I am a greedy reader, part time musician, science fan and ACM, IEEE and Computer Society member. Last but not least, in term of biological achievements, I am married (so my selfish genes have won) and my wife and I have released three new versions (one boy and two girls) of a new mixed and refurbished DNA.</p>",,2013-05-13 17:14:35.413000+00:00,2017-05-18 20:27:45.640000+00:00,United Kingdom,1,0,0,6,https://i.stack.imgur.com/XAl0m.png?s=128&g=1,http://insomne.org

3558,6240567,Geoff James,"<p><strong>Greetings.</strong></p>

<p><strong>What I do:</strong><br>
<em>By day</em>, I'm a Windows App developer for a large software company.<br>
<em>By night</em>, I'm a Windows App developer for a large software company.</p>

<p>Most of the rest of my time is consumed by family; either being annoying or needy - or both.</p>

<p>And when I get <em>any</em> time at all to myself; I end up doing freelance software and web development</p>

<p><strong>What I like:</strong><br>
I enjoy programming, and I believe that everyday is a learning curve. Always something new to get out of each day.</p>

<p>I also like to eat. Lot. Lots and lots. But hey, what else can you do whilst sitting down at a computer all day?</p>

<p><strong>Fun facts:</strong><br>
I'm fun.</p>

<p><strong>More fun facts:</strong><br>
When Jon Skeet's answers get downvoted (which is never), the downvote is automatically reversed by a multitude of 10; the original downvoter is then banished from the face of the Earth.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br>
Life is sweet. Life is short. Don't waste it.<br>
Be happy and enjoy the little things; they won't be round for too long.</p>

<p>Just remember - the Earth is billions of years old, and you're just about going to make it to 90 (if you're lucky).</p>",,2016-04-22 11:59:08.650000+00:00,2020-05-29 22:43:11.477000+00:00,United Kingdom,2677,764,381,558,,
3559,6583298,Norbert Boros,"<p><strong>Problem solver:</strong> </p>

<p>Without problems there wouldn't be a need for software.
All software is designed to solve some user problem and within that general solution is a wide array of smaller problems that make it up.</p>

<p>It really doesn't matter what programming language or technology you use, if you can't solve problems, you won't be very good at developing software.</p>

<p><strong>Teaching myself:</strong> </p>

<p>In the past years I have trained myself because there is probably no more important skill in life than learning to learn. This skill is especially important in software development, because no field I know of changes more rapidly than software development.</p>

<p>You can't know everything about everything, so I don`t. You can't even really invest the time it takes to be a master of one particular framework or technology because things are moving way too fast!</p>",,2016-07-13 08:09:25.417000+00:00,2020-05-31 05:10:22.410000+00:00,United Kingdom,921,524,15,248,https://i.stack.imgur.com/5xZmG.jpg?s=128&g=1,

<p>I'm a hard working engineer with great communication skills. I'm very passionate about engineering web applications. I'm comfortable with full stack development, TDD, agile methodologies and design-related areas such as UX and typography (I'm a bit of a type nerd!).</p>

<p>My skills encompass both engineering and design. This enables me to provide valuable feedback in during code review and design iterations.</p>

<p>Regarding engineering, I build systems designed for change, extensibility, maintainability, and modularity. I practice TDD, follow style guides and use tools like ESLint and Flow to ensure code quality. I'm always looking to improve my code design skills and process. I try to adopt ideas from Functional Programming, the SOLID principles and Domain Driven Design.</p>

<p>I apply the same amount of rigour when it comes to building a visual design. I put a strong emphasis on UX and Product Design. I strive to make the experience as well crafted as the code behind it.
I like getting involved in the community, and try to get to at least one conference each year. </p>

Officially employed as .NET developer, I don’t restrict myself to this platform and I stay curious about other technologies, concepts and programming languages. I listen regularly to podcasts, particularly around software architecture, which also spawned my desire to work with a distributed system using cutting-edge technologies like Kafka and Kubernetes. That is also how I discovered and started to study Martin Kleppmann's excellent book “Designing Data-Intensive Applications” to lay the foundations to work in data-intensive environments.</p>

I have a broad and fundamental understanding of technology and trust myself to dive down to every technical level that is required to find a solution to a problem.

<p>Hello my name is Alex, and i love to code, I have coding for about 4 years now, most of my experience being the java programming language using the eclipse IDE> I also code a few other programming languages  with experience in C#, Visual Basic and MATLAB. I am currently a student but hope to soon get a job to boost my ability and reinforce my ability to work with others in a team.
Many of my current projects can be found on GitHub, a although I hardly ever have time to finish any of them. Steal my code if you want I don’t mind as long as you learn something from it!
I enjoy learning new things hence my computer skills are always improving, my aim on stack overflow is to help others learn to code and increase the abilities of others</p>

4439,5378757,Aamir-Aka,"<p>Aamir Aka (born 1975) is a British-Pakistani businessman currently based in the Middle East. He is the Founder and CEO of Adivo Consulting, Adivo Search &amp; Selection and Adivo Manpower Supply.</p>

<p>Aamir moved to London in 1986 at age 11 with his family, having previously lived in Egypt and the UAE. Aamir's father spent 25 years working as an International Banker travelling the world in the 1980’s and 90’s before establishing his own Finance business in London which he retired from in 2013. His mother is a dedicated housewife who invested all her time and efforts in raising her four sons who are now enjoy flourishing International careers. Aamir studied at the British International School in Cairo till the age of 11 and then at Highgate Boys School in London thereafter. At school, Aamir completed his GCSE’s and A-levels whilst enjoying an active sporting life playing for the school’s first eleven football, cricket and rugby team. In addition, Aamir captained the school Water Polo team as well as the Eton Fives team on several occasions.</p>

<p>At age 16, while still at secondary school, Aamir established his own designer Menswear business in London after learning from his experience of weekend working at the leading menswear retailer, Cecil Gees. Selling formal suits and other designer clothes from a friends warehouse/garage, Aamir paid for his way through A-level and University as well as put some money aside to go towards a deposit he would put on his first London flat after finishing university.</p>

<p>At age 18 in 1993, Aamir went on to read Management/Business Studies/Economics at City University Business School in London. In his second year, Aamir was elected as President of the University Student Union. A position he relinquished in his third year after completing his summer internship at Coopers and Lybrand in 1995. A summer with Coopers confirmed to Aamir that he was suited to a life in Advisory and enjoyed the client interface aspect of working life. Rejecting the offer of a permanent role in Audit with Coopers and Lybrand, Aamir applied for the Graduate Development Programme at Andersen Consulting (now known as Accenture). In 1996, Aamir joined Andersen Consulting and worked with them on over a dozen projects till 2001 within the Supply Chain Practice.</p>

<p>In 2001, Aamir left Andersen Consulting to start his own Management Consulting Business – Adivo Consulting.</p>

<p>Adivo Consulting is a leading Management Consulting firm specializing in the area of Operational Improvement and Performance Excellence.</p>

<p><strong>Interests/Hobbies</strong></p>

<p>Aamir gets to enjoy one of his most passionate interest of travelling. Having visited over 100 countries for business and pleasure – Aamir enjoys trying different cuisines and cultures on his travels.</p>

<p>In addition, Aamir continues to enjoy his sports – albeit at a less competitive level. His greatest passion and hobby continues to be his collection of cars.</p>",,2015-09-26 08:00:08.093000+00:00,2015-11-15 06:58:03.690000+00:00,United Kingdom,1,0,0,39,https://i.stack.imgur.com/OSXf3.jpg?s=128&g=1,http://www.adivo.me

I see what people have created through code, I want to learn how to code so I can create my own game/website/forums and more! I hope if I ask a question it is straight to the point and easy to understand for use.

4545,1578801,NigelW,"<p>I started commercial programming on 1 September 1981 as a trainee COBOL programmer on a Honeywell Level 64 mainframe. During the 1980’s I flipped between Honeywell/Bull and IBM mainframes, with a brief spell in 1988 on a 386 PC developing in COBOL and using Lotus-123 and Oracle, but not at the same time.
In 1993 I went freelance and have created PC software and since 1999 websites and web based applications.</p>

<p>Operations Support has also developed Restoration Manager, a software tool designed to help vehicle restorers keep track of the parts they remove from vehicles. </p>

<p>Due to having car sick children we also sell sick bags under the trade name of Chuckie Bags. An odd thing to deal in, but it beats having to clean the inside of the car every week.</p>

<p>Every month from November 1996 to December 1999 I was invited to appear on the Roger Day show on Guildford’s County Sound radio station, where we would discuss a number of IT related topics. An audience of 100,000 now seems small in comparison to the potential audience on the Internet, but there’s nothing like live radio to really concentrate the mind!</p>",,2012-08-06 09:17:36.353000+00:00,2017-07-26 10:55:26.353000+00:00,United Kingdom,1,0,0,0,https://i.stack.imgur.com/XasU5.jpg,http://www.operations-support.co.uk

Our focus on customer service, thorough knowledge of product, and friendly manner has remained unchanged since our inception in 1983. We are also the longest running Interline operator in the UK. Most of our clients are repeat clients, we are delighted to say, but we welcome new clients with as much gusto. We like to see as many destinations and holiday accommodations as we can, so we can offer you the very best advice. 
Our primary goal is to make sure you have the right holiday at a budget that you are comfortable with. That is why our customer retention rates are so high, and our customer service is award-winning and rated as excellent (on average). Sometimes friends and family of airline employees might be eligible to use the interline rates to travel, as can retired airline staff. When travelling standby, standby travel protection (Offload Policy) is often available, depending on the hotel (for interline bookings only).</p>",,2018-10-13 03:47:20.250000+00:00,2018-10-13 03:47:20.250000+00:00,United Kingdom,1,0,0,0,,https://sunnyescapes.co.uk

<p>My colleagues and clients display significant confidence in my skills, flexibility, abilities and communication skills (please see my references). I am pro-active in my approach to problem-solving and willing to go the extra mile. </p>

If you are a qualified social care worker, looking into applying for social care jobs, you first need to consider where your knowledge, expertise and experience lie, as there are many different sectors within the social care industry looking to recruit. Depending on your experience you may be better suited to working with children and families, patients in hospitals, the elderly, or perhaps people with either physical or mental disabilities.  Many <a href=""http://www.cardearesourcing.com/jobs/"" rel=""nofollow"">social care jobs</a> involve assessing and evaluating situations, care management, and support work of various levels of complexity.

I am sure that we are happy even with one, especially if it is a <a href=""http://www.infinity-jewellery.com/6-engagement-rings"" rel=""nofollow"">diamond engagement rings</a>. Few weeks are setting us apart from Christmas and if this year you are going to propose to your loved one, it is better to be prepared in advance and start thinking of a way to make this festive season one to be remembered.
At Infinity Jewellery, with the help of the very easy to navigate website, with the expertise of our gemmologists who source the best stones on the market and the exquisite craftsmanship of our goldsmiths, it will be possible to order the perfect ring in time to be delivered at your office desk or home address and surprise the person in your life with the perfect ring.
But Christmas is not only that time of the year to be engaged. The choice of diamond jewellery that you can find browsing the Infinity Jewellery website is so wide that virtually anything on display is perfect to put a smile on the receiver’s face.
I can just picture in my mind the expression on someone’s face when presented with a small box. It screams “jewellery” from every angle and once opened it will unveil something that you have been deeply thought and chosen for the person you care for. This gift will be one that it will be shown to everybody with pride and pleasure. So in order to achieve this, it is better to think ahead and start looking for hints of what can be given. If a ring it is too much, maybe a pair of earrings, or a bracelet, or a pendant would be a great present. Modern lovers might appreciate to share a pair of ear studs wearing it one each and a teenager would feel grown up with a diamond pendant with the name’s initial in 18carat white gold.
Infinity Jewellery has got its workshops in the jewellery quarter in London, Hatton Garden, home to the goldsmith craft for centuries, since the medieval times and all its piece of jewellery come with the London Assay Office Hallmark which guarantee the quality of the metal used. Infinity Jewellery has got collections to suit all the budgets and now many items are on sale just for a limited period of time with great savings on its 18ct gold diamonds jewellery. 
Every item comes with a certificate attesting the quality of the stones set, a nice black suede lined box and if desired it can be delivered in an outer cream coloured box including a gift bag and tag.</p>",,2013-11-28 17:40:22.603000+00:00,2013-12-01 08:53:28.620000+00:00,United Kingdom,1,0,0,1,https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1,http://www.infinity-jewellery.com

5732,2049266,Mel,"<p>I pretty much only have two hobbies, html-ing, and video gaming.
Socially, when I do venture out into the wilderness past the front door, I attend raves (uk hardcore), and football matches.</p>

<p>I'm also thinking creatively often, and have dabbled in DJing, making music, making videos, visualising better web designs when I visit a slowas and cluttered website.</p>

<p>My main flaw is, I have too many projects going on in my head, so many things never get complete in a reasonable time scale. Friends take the pish and constantly tell me I have aspergers.</p>

<p>My interests are science, space, and music. Music was my first love, it will always be my last.</p>

<p>I hate wars and governments.</p>

<p>I comfort myself by dreaming about being on a different planet, away from all the evil doings on this amazing, but prison like, blue marble planet known as Earth.</p>",,2013-02-07 03:33:49.600000+00:00,2013-02-18 09:35:28.167000+00:00,United Kingdom,11,0,0,5,,

-PHP and MySQL-I'm building a collaboration platform for projects witha couple of my friends based on PHP, MySQL and using HTML5. When I finish I'll learn JS and upgrade it to an Ajax system<br>

<p>I left the academia in the late 80's and have been working in the Industry ever since. </p>

<p>The academic background forms a substantial strength in my work. Trained as a compiler writer first, capable to relate high-level theoretical issues to implementations at a programming level - as my doctorate thesis shows. </p>

<p>In the industry I have worked mainly in a UNIX/Linux environment in areas such as word processing; printing; laser printers; scanners; graphic environment with page layout and design; conversion of programs from one programming language to another and from one operating system to another; electronic commerce (e-commerce); web design; and many, many others. </p>

<p>During the last ten years I have worked as an architect, application designer and programmer in a Big Data innovative front edge company. In this area I have been able to show my main skills:</p>

I've been programming every day for around 38 years, and have dabbled in a huge variety of languages and platforms, the best being ARM assembler in the early '90s. Glorious! Since then I've focussed on C, C++, and now C#. But now my phone has an ARM in it... hmmm... :-)

<p>
I do all this on my sluggish 3GHz quad-core, pining for the good old days when I had a blazingly fast 8MHz CPU and didn't have to wait all day for my word processor to display the next character :-)</p>

<p>Among many other things I have worked on the worlds fastest vector art package, many games including Douglas Adams' Starship Titanic and Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy, and a subsea flight simulator.

<li>Java Script</li>
<li>Magik</li>

<p>Some of the programming languages that I have learnt and used recently are Swift and Kotlin. But since I love programming, and I wanted to write some back-end codes with Java Script, I have started to use NodeJS and some of the available libraries.</p>

<p>The problem that I have is that I have not enough time to learn every thing and it is just so sad, cause I can not give up upon any of mobile, back-end, front-end, desktop, web and even embedded programming! I want to be on top of all of it. I wish I had 72 hours a day!</p>

<p>Oh, I should say that I have been programming with Magik (Yes! with K) since 2005.</p>

  <p><strong>I’ve been told that I should never use multiple inheritance. Is that</strong>
  <strong>right?</strong></p>
  
  <p>Grrrrrrrrr.</p>
  
  <p>It really bothers me when people think they know what’s best for your
  problem even though they’ve never seen your problem!! How can anybody
  possibly know that multiple inheritance won’t help you accomplish your
  goals without knowing your goals?!?!?!?!!!</p>
  
  <p>Next time somebody tells you that you should never use multiple
  inheritance, look them straight in the eye and say, “One size does not
  fit all.” If they respond with something about their bad experience on
  their project, look them in the eye and repeat, slower this time, “One
  size does not fit all.”</p>
  
  <p>People who spout off one-size-fits-all rules presume to make your
  design decisions without knowing your requirements. They don’t know
  where you’re going but know how you should get there.</p>
  
  <p>Don’t trust an answer from someone who doesn’t know the question.</p>

6842,277358,sigi,"<p>Martin finished his PhD in 2012 (Thesis tile: A Treatise on Web 2.0 with a Case Study from the Financial Markets), and has worked as an RA for the Computer Science department at Loughborough and Leicester Universities, and most recently at Information Science department at Loughborough, where he worked on the EMOTIVE project. Currently he is a permanent staff member at this University, where he is an Assistant Professor in Information Management.</p>

<p>His research is concerned with analysis of web 2.0 systems and their uses in practical real world applications for problem solving, such as national security in the EMOTIVE project. The computational analysis of web 2.0 systems is one of his major interests because the datasets and the dynamics of these applications are still not fully understood. Yet they hold great promise in a number of domains. Among Martin’s other interests are the fields of data mining, text mining, time-series prediction, and information management and information processing. Martin has also spent a considerable amount of time on interesting problems in the Financial Markets domain with a couple published papers at peer reviewed conferences, including a best IEEE PhD student conference paper award at SOFA 2009. Martin has also led tutorials for final year Data Mining students and acted as a lecturer for the Computer Science Department for two semesters at Loughborough University, teaching Fundamentals in Programming and Web based JavaScript programming.</p>",,2010-02-19 21:50:56.103000+00:00,2020-05-27 06:58:19.250000+00:00,United Kingdom,143,87,0,27,,http://www.martinsykora.com

8139,10070134,Judge Malcolm Simmons,"<p><strong>Judge Malcolm Simmons- Understanding the Physical Requirements to Play American Football</strong></p>

<p>American Football is an incredibly physical sport. At any moment in the game, players are crashing into each other at high speeds, fighting and wrestling for superiority. The game is frantic, fast paced and to the untrained eye nothing short of chaotic. However, as physical as the sport is, it may be surprising to find out that you don’t need to be a particularly physical person to play the game. In fact, you don’t even need to be in shape.</p>

<p>In order to prove that to you, let’s take a look at the physicality of a number of players from the world’s most successful American Football league, the National Football League in the United States.</p>

<p>Of course, as with any sport at its highest level, the NFL is filled with supremely athletic individuals. <strong><a href=""https://malcolmsimmonsbestfootballplayer.wordpress.com/2018/04/23/malcolm-simmons-understanding-the-physical-requirements-to-play-american-football/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Judge Malcolm Simmons</a></strong>, running back for the Minnesota Vikings, is 6 feet and 1 inch tall (1.85m) and weighs 217 lb (98 kg). From a standing position, he can jump 38.5 inches vertically and 10 feet 7 inches horizontally. If you led two average sized women head to toe he could clear both of them with relative ease.</p>

<p>Vikings running back Malcolm Simmons utilises a devastating combination of speed and power that makes him one of the most physical sportsmen in the world</p>

<p>While that kind of athleticism would obviously give you a huge advantage in a sport as physical as American football, it is not essential to play the game. You don’t have to look like Hercules to be successful on the grid-iron. One of the best qualities the sport has to offer is that it is a sport that caters to a lot of different types of athleticism.</p>

<p>If you turn on an American football game on a Sunday afternoon, you will see a real variety of physical appearances among the players. It is, in a way, a bit like Rugby; there are positions dependent on strength and power, and others dependent on speed. American football is a more exaggerated version of this. Take, for example, Trindon Holliday and Terrence Cody. Holliday is a wide receiver and kick returner for the Denver Broncos. He is only 5 feet 5 inches tall, and when he stands on the field he truly looks like a boy among men.</p>

<p>Despite this, Holliday is one of the most dangerous players in the National Football League. He is extremely fast, and because of his small stature he is actually very difficult for larger men to try and tackle.</p>",,2018-07-12 10:55:42.060000+00:00,2018-07-12 11:27:20.393000+00:00,United Kingdom,1,0,0,1,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-yLZWExv7u8U/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAL0/Pu_LljHdtE4/photo.jpg?sz=128,http://socialnewsbymalcolmsimmons.blogspot.com/

8416,3283131,Jo-fai Chow,"<p>Jo-fai (Joe) is a data scientist at H2O.ai. Before joining H2O, he was in the business intelligence team at Virgin Media where he developed data products to enable quick and smart business decisions. He also worked remotely for Domino Data Lab as a data science evangelist promoting products via blogging and giving talks at external events. </p>

<p>Joe has a background in water engineering. Before his data science journey, he was an EngD researcher at STREAM Industrial Doctorate Centre working on machine learning techniques for drainage design optimization. Prior to that, he was an asset management consultant specialized in data mining and constrained optimization for the utilities sector in UK and abroad. He also holds a MSc in Environmental Management and a BEng in Civil Engineering.</p>

<p>Long before Joe immersed himself in the world of open-source R and Python, he learned his trade as an avid MATLAB user. When he was a kid, his parents taught him one of the famous old Chinese sayings - when one drinks water, one must not forget where it comes from. So when Twitter asked Joe to be creative, he simply put down @matlabulous as his handle.</p>

<p>In the summer of 2014, his data visualization side project 'CrimeMap' led him to a poster presentation at useR! 2014 where he heard about H2O for the very first time.

Written for ASICs through to Windows apps so have been around the block a bit. Mainly written for Educational publishing in recent years, getting heavily into ASP.NET at the moment and looking at MVC for my next apps.

<p>I read a lot of programming blogs, and try to learn new features by solving the ProjectEuler challenges. </p>

9654,898509,Ali Exalter,"<p>Hi, I am a programmer who write about thousand lines of code every working day of the week. I have understanding of programming. I use my skills to build large internal bespoke systems. I worked for UK based company, SoftwareStudio part of Subhani Brothers Ltd, both as freelancer and permanent full-time employee. During my freelance with SoftwareStudio I did 6 months contract as senior mobile developer at AppStart in Salford, Greater Manchester. 
During my work I built small websites using CSS,HTML, JAVAScript, large bespoke management systems like taxi and bus booking system (taxiquoter.co.uk, nationalminibushire.com), property management system, logistic system and I built mobile games and applications. The large systems involved databases (MySQL and SQL Server), server side programming (C# ASP.Net MVC and PHP). 
For mobile games I use CoronaSDK which compile LUA programming language. I also built native apps in iOS working in Object-C. For android I used JAVA. I also built cross platform mobile applications using IONIC framework and jQuery Mobile. I build my browser based apps using Cordova and Phonegap build service by Adobe. 
I also built bespoke Wordpress websites by working with top UK designers such as Devote Associates and AvalancheCreative. I have built my own Wordpress plugins for some of the websites and also made changes to Wordpress admin section to be more business friendly.
I have been programming for 12 years and for last 5 years all my projects are on bit bucket and GitHub organised having track of all my commits, issues and milestones.
I would like to travel the world, meet new people, learn different programming approaches, discover new ideas and meet new people. I am big fan of World of Warcraft. I played only games made by Activision Blizzard and UbiSoft. I would love to work with good people.

10626,13495724,coreymwamba,"<p>Born and based in Derby, Dr Corey Mwamba's commitment to jazz and improvised music in Britain and Ireland drives all aspects of his work, whether through making, presenting, promoting, or researching music.</p>

<p>Corey predominantly plays vibraphone; he also plays dulcimer and uses audio processing software. He is recognised as a highly creative improviser and composer working across a wide range of jazz and contemporary music. Mwamba's distinctive approach and tone is instantly recognisable in any context: a potent blend of pure sound, highly melodic phrases and ethereal textures; barely whispered chords and ear-piercing robotic screams. Corey won a PRSF/Jerwood Foundation Take Five artist development award in 2007; was short-listed for the Innovation category in the BBC Jazz Awards in 2008; and received nominations for ""Rising Star on Vibraphone"" in the 62nd, 63rd, 64th, 65th, 66th, and 67th DownBeat Annual Critics' Polls.</p>

<p>Corey Mwamba retired from public performance in March 2019.</p>

<p>Corey Mwamba is the current presenter of Freeness, a weekly show on BBC Radio 3. The programme plays adventurous jazz and improvised music from across the globe.</p>

<p>Corey is also an adventurous programmer of new music in Derby, setting up One Note Sunday and The Family Album as well as programming Derby Jazz's improvised music stream called 2ndline. Currently he is the lead administrator of Out Front!, an East Midlands-based new music promoting/producing organisation. He was the artistic director of Derby Jazz from 2016 to 2020.</p>

<p>An active advocate of the arts, Corey Mwamba strives to argue the case for its place in society. He petitioned for fair pay to artists during the London Olympics, and helped engineer a moratorium and review of arts funding cuts in Derby through debate with the city council; he has also worked with many regional arts organisations. He has held board positions for Derby Jazz, World Song Derby, Derby Cultural Diversity Arts Network, and Arts Council England (East Midlands). He is currently on the advisory board for Attenborough Arts Centre.</p>

<p>Mwamba was granted an AHRC studentship for a Master of Research degree in Music at Keele University, for which he was awarded a distinction in 2014. Through this research, he developed new dark art, which is a notational and theoretical music system that takes early European medieval music practice as a starting point to create modern music. He was recently awarded a doctorate in Jazz Research at Birmingham City University, which was funded by a Midlands3Cities/AHRC studentship.</p>",,2020-05-08 03:50:31.197000+00:00,2020-05-08 04:05:37.690000+00:00,United Kingdom,1,0,0,0,https://i.stack.imgur.com/JgRy8.jpg?s=128&g=1,https://www.coreymwamba.co.uk

Move on to 2010, and I 'discovered' GNU/Linux. I fell in love with it, and have been using it and trying to understand it ever since.

While we searching for accountant, we read advertisement for <a href=""http://giddh.com/accountingsoftware.php"" rel=""nofollow"">online accounting software</a>, we went through the details of the advertisement, into the details of what is the software about and then finally we decided to for getting software for accounts.</p>

<p>There are many companies which provide software for accounts, some do only the calculation part, some even provide report for the performance and there are many features that made accounting real easy and interesting. It was very easy to use it and there was no need for any <a href=""http://giddh.com/accountingsoftware.php"" rel=""nofollow"">online accounting</a> experience.

Limited knowledge of how the web works IE HTML CSS and indeed studied a CIW course way way back just as CSS first came out and we were amazed at the use of frames!!! Then parenthood struck and I was sucked back into a world of work. Working for a printers and looking their environmental accreditations. Then zip a dee doo dah day... Recession struck and we all got made redundant. Since then I have decided to do what I have a serious passion for and that is web development with only myself to study with and so far I enjoy what I have achieved. Now after learning that Twitter was built with Ruby on Rails I have decided to study this language as have a great idea for a website (Don't we all!?!) Stumbled across this site and will be asking questions in time hope to be answering them but as for now... that's all folks</p>,,2013-05-07 12:39:41.387000+00:00,2015-08-12 12:30:19.330000+00:00,United Kingdom,1,0,0,0,https://i.stack.imgur.com/8nllo.jpg,

11222,12252799,John Smith,"<p>Hi I'm John Smith from Loanago. We are providing all types of loans. A personal loan is a type of unsecured loan, and this means you don’t have to provide any collateral or security. Some lending institutions may ask you to get a guarantor before they accept your personal loan application.</p>

<p>Usually, banks ask for a guarantor only when they aren’t completely comfortable with your financial standing and repayment capability. Loans with a guarantor are ideal for those you have a poor credit rating or no credit record yet.

<p>My initial interest in this sector actually started with Digital Marketing 12 years ago, when I used to create niche websites with WordPress. I wasn’t a developer then but did know my way around this platform with existing themes to launch many sites.</p>

<p>My interest then evolved into web development, which made me think about a formal qualification. This is not critical to be a developer, but I saw it as an opportunity to grow personally and professionally.</p>

<p>I attended the University of Northampton between 2014 and 2017. I studied Business Computing(Web Design) and was awarded a BSc first class, Hons. The experience proved excellent, especially the soft skills that can only be gained in that kind of environment.</p>

11667,4007694,Orazio Principe,"<p>PHP</p>

<p>I start to develop with php on 1999 when php was a simple procedural language like the old Microsoft asp.
From there I begin to learn every day new methods, technology and follow the com- plete road map for php.
I develop with php with a strong object oriented scheme and I use it to make back-end and front-end section. Many time I use php also for server scripting, automatic cron jobs, one shot script and on many other ways.</p>

<p>MYSQL</p>

<p>I knew this database when I started to use php. By now I use it in very different solu- tions. I made standalone servers, replica servers schemes, and clustered database sys- tems.</p>

<p>I’d help a very popular team to fix bugs about cluster sync with many masters solutions using Percona XtraDB Cluster.</p>

<p>Resuming I know mysql with his most important features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Different table engine types, views, stored procedures, triggers and events - Setting one or more read only replica</li>
<li>Setting up multi master scheme</li>
<li>Setting up cluster database system</li>
</ul>

<p>SPHINX</p>

<p>Sphinx is a full text search engine that I currently use to search into very big dataset. With big dataset I mean more or less 200.000.000 records daily updated.</p>

<p>WEB SERVERS</p>

<p>Big experience with apache web server configuration including proxy with nginx
HTML AND WEB SCRIPTING
Html, Javascript, jQuery, CSS and every concerning client side scripting is very familiar and easy to use. Big knowledge with js object oriented programming</p>

<p>SERVERS CONFIGURATIONS</p>

<p>I can setup from scratch a complete server with any linux operating system configuring on it each of these most important services:
• webserver
• databaseserver
• mailserver
• cacheserver
• clusteredfilesystem
• clusterdatabasesystem • backupserver
• proceduresserver</p>",,2014-09-04 11:17:15.623000+00:00,2019-07-23 08:15:47.053000+00:00,United Kingdom,11,0,0,3,https://i.stack.imgur.com/dcr9s.jpg,https://www.phpclasses.org/browse/author/103331.html

<p>My main use of cycling is getting to and from work on a daily basis. Although it's a relatively short distance of 7 miles each way, I enjoy the fresh morning air and ability to avoid all of the traffic jams working in a city brings.</p>

<p>My biggest cycling achievement was when I cycled through 14 countries in 14 days for the charity Reverse Rett. Myself and two other rides started in Glasgow, Scotland and cycled throughout each country in the UK (including Republic of Ireland) and then went on to cycle to northern Italy. We raised over £30,000 for our effort and thank everybody who supported us.</p>

<p>I got back into cycling at the end of the 2012 London Olympic games after I was inspired by Team GB. I purchased my bike through a cycle to work scheme and have never regretted making the decision. </p>

12227,297683,ClarkeyBoy,"<p>I am currently developing a website in VB.Net with CSS/SASS, JQuery and JQuery UI for Heritage Art Papers Ltd which achieved 66% as my final year project at university.. It was the dissertation which let me down.. The website has a full administration frontend for editing what end users see on the customer frontend. My aim over the period I am working on it is for administrators to eventually be able to add and remove attributes for specific types of item (that is: Range, Collection, Design, RangeCollection, CollectionDesign and RangeCollectionDesign [the final product with a product code]). They will then be able to reference these in the item template for the catalogue by using square brackets. Over time the system should become very sophisticated, and should log all actions (big or small) and highlight the important ones to admin - for example hacking attempts.</p>

<p>I know CSS/SASS, HTML (obviously), ASP, ASP.Net (VB), PHP (a bit), Java (a bit) and JQuery/JQuery UI. I would like to learn C++ or C#, but to be honest I just dont have the time at the moment.</p>

PHP + MySQL (PDO connection)
HTML/CSS/JS - Including very basic design. I am more of a coder than designer, if at all a designer ;)
CompTIA A+ and several Microsoft Quals.</p>

<hr>

<p>I am a (reasonably) young person, who likes to explore the IT industry. I went from learning HTML at school, to quickly moving on to ASP within weeks. After exploring better options, I came across PHP and have since coded in PHP and MySQL. </p>

<p>In between all of this, I've always been into the hardware and software side of computers, exploring how and why things work. 
Rebuilding PC's was trivial for me, I wanted a challenge - Debugging; What has caused said issue? And exploring the avenues surrounding the problem and coming up with a fix. </p>

<p>After leaving school I went to college, and gained a BTEC 1st Diploma in computing, and very shortly after that, I went on an apprentice and came out with Microsoft (MCP, Networking Fundamentals, OS fundamentals and more) and CompTIA A+ quals.</p>

<p>As of 2013 however, I am looking into scalability - How do I setup my own mini-datacentre, and to make it more of a challenge I am attempting to do so with Linux.

After working behind the desk in IT organisations for many years, where developers were constantly delegated to second-grade citizens, I realised that there is a great opportunity in building a company that was centred around software developers.

hedgehog lab is now pioneering the use of Web 2.0 concepts in the enterprise and helping deliver greatly simplified software to allow large and agile teams to collaborate.

<p>I have a large interest in Aviation, Chemistry, and Birdwatching. 
My hobbies include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Lighting my hands on fire.</p></li>
<li><p>Getting forcefully removed from airports, because ""I cant keep taking pictures of every TSA worker and of every plane that lands"".</p></li>
<li><p>crying</p></li>
<li><p>Drinking tea, mainly Black tea, Rooibos, and sometimes, Green tea, and the occasional Whiskey. Talisker Skye is a favourite.</p></li>
<li><p>Playing video games like, Destiny 2, Deep Rock Galactic, Kerbal Space Program, Minecraft, and pretty much every driving sim you can think of.</p></li>
<li><p>Rethinking life choices, and crying, but louder.</p></li>
<li><p>Telling my self I'll go running tomorrow, because tomorrow  I will have more energy. I tend to do that, everyday.</p></li>
<li><p>And lastly, Listening to music. I have three playlists:</p>

<ol>
<li>Rock, soft rock, hard rock, <em>pebbles</em>, pop, and electronic</li>
<li>Pretty much the same, but if any family members ask what I listen to, I send this one to avoid getting judged.</li>
<li>Non vocal, instrumental music. Mainly if i need to concentrate, which is usually, everyday.</li>
</ol></li>

All of the holiday packages that we offer are tailor made which offers a great deal of flexibility to the customer when planning their <a href=""https://www.offthemap.travel/northern-lights-holidays/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">northern lights trips</a> but also requires a sophisticated level of coding to facilitate this level of flexibility through the website.

<ul>
<li>I'm a big gamer, and I'm currently getting my teeth into <a href=""http://masteroverwatch.com/profile/xbl/global/Quartz%20Cutter"" rel=""nofollow"">Overwatch on Xbox One</a>. <strike>Mei</strike> Mercy is bae. And don't expect to see much from those stats, I'm a <em>casul gitting gud</em>.</li>
<li>Rollerblading isn't dead and I still find time to grind some ledges, skate some halfpipes and break some bones (though I try not to).</li>
<li>Architecture and Graphic Design are great skills for an app developer and I'm glad to have studied in those fields despite my move into development.</li>
<li><strong>Currently learning</strong>; Swift; Realm; HTML; CSS; JS.</li>
<li><strong>Future learning</strong>; Python; ABAP; ???.</li>

<p>Anxiety can affect people of all ages, from all different lifestyles. You might feel helpless to do anything about it as well as frightened and anxious. You'll be happy to know that you can do something in regards to this. The following contains some advice that can help you deal with anxiety better.</p>

<p>If your stress is chronic and unresolvable by normal methods, you may want to consult a doctor. Your doctor can discuss the latest medical options available to help you cope with your symptoms. So get the proper treatment by making time for a doctor visit.</p>

<p>Find a person that you can confide in. Look to this person as an ear when you need to talk about your anxious feelings. If you have a trusted person to discuss problems with, you can keep from trapping feelings inside. Keeping your feelings inside will make you feel more isolated and can worsen your situation.</p>

<p>Set goals for yourself every day. Keep focusing on your daily goal. This will keep your mind occupied and prevent you from thinking negatively and causing anxiety.</p>

<p>Always think about the positives in your life. Make it a habit to remind yourself of these things before you go to sleep and again first thing in the morning. Focusing on these positives will keep negative thoughts from finding their way into your mind and therefore, decrease the frequency of anxious moments.</p>

<p>Learn about how amino acids can be used as an anxiety treatment or even a cure. Low levels of some essential nutritional requirements can be a trigger for anxiety in some people. There are many published works that discuss the treatment of anxiety with non-prescription supplements.</p>

<p>Find someone that you can talk to about your feelings. Keeping your feelings and thoughts to yourself is only going to make you feel much worse. Expressing your feeling will allow you to feel better and will reduce your anxiety.</p>

<p>Don't surround yourself with individuals that stress you out. Negative friends, for example, are not a good influence on anxiety. If you are unable to deal with people who cause you stress, avoid them until you learn to handle them.</p>

<p>As you can see, you can reduce the anxiety in your life. Those were a few of the ways that you can get rid of some of it. Apply the things that you have learned in this guide, and use them every day. It is possible to manage anxiety.</p>",,2019-03-22 18:18:28.757000+00:00,2019-03-25 16:21:24.853000+00:00,United Kingdom,1,0,0,0,https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/53dea9cd096917133fd2c764bde4cf24?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1,http://ttlink.com/ishva

<p>I'm currently using VB at school, learning some basic Python at home, and will perhaps learn the basics of some other languages for university if I have the time (I do, but effort). <br> I suck at web development in general, and I especially hate that, since I've only used DreamWeaver and Notepad, when I write HTML I'm never told me <em>why</em> I'm wrong, I can only observe that I'm wrong - time to find one tag I didn't close in a sea of code.</p>

<hr>

<p>There are some things I don't enjoy, but despite that, on the whole I'm looking forward to learning CS for many years to come :)</p>

Obviously you will be looking forward to bringing your child into the world, but it can feel like there is a number of overwhelming things to think about. Many new parents prepare themselves for the birth of their child by reading <a href=""http://www.nest-shop.co.uk/books"" rel=""nofollow"">parenting books</a>. There are a variety of parenting books you can read, including advice through pregnancy, what to expect during labour, and tips on parenting, right through until your child is in their teenage years. Expectant mothers in particular, take comfort in reading these books, as it can help them feel more prepared, and more ready for the journey they have ahead of them. They aren’t just for mothers though, there are also books available for expectant fathers, to help them understand what their partner is going through, and prepare them for the birth of their child.</p>",,2012-08-13 03:31:03.133000+00:00,2012-08-17 07:29:19.013000+00:00,United Kingdom,1,0,0,2,,http://www.nest-shop.co.uk/

14394,9202109,Elizabeth A. Halsted,"<p>An infographic , in a nutshell, is a creative way of taking words and representing them with an image. Currently, readers are looking for quick access to short information, says Jeff Bullas . Website visitors love this unique form of presentation that is rapidly gaining popularity and, in some cases, is becoming the standard form of communication instead of the long and extensive blog posts.<a href=""http://dreamassignmenthelp.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Assignment Help Writing Services</a></p>

<p>In this way, infographics have become one of the most popular forms of content marketing in contemporary digital media.</p>

<p>These days we receive 5 times more information than in 1986 and we are 80 percent more willing to read anything with colors. Likewise, 45 percent more users will click on a link if they have an infographic.</p>

<p>So we present four tools available for the generation of this type of products.</p>

<ol>
<li>Visme.co</li>
</ol>

<p>Visme is a manufacturer of infographics that allows creating interactive presentations, infographics, advertising banners, animations, customer designs, among other functions. It has an extensive library full of templates, forms, icons as well as objects to choose from.</p>

<p>It is an application highly recommended by Coursework Spot, an academic research service. Another positive point is that it has a special price for teachers and students, which means that it is also accessible to entrepreneurs online, its premium cost is $ 16 per month.</p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li>Easel.ly</li>
</ol>

<p>This creator of infographics will help you put together an image with just a few clicks. In the first instance, you can choose a template from the list of cards, later a search bar as well as a drop-down menu that will allow you to filter the results of the template.</p>

<p>Likewise, you can add shapes, backgrounds, graphics, objects as well as texts. The basic version is offered at no cost.</p>

<ol start=""3"">
<li>Visualize.me</li>
</ol>

<p>This tool focuses on allowing users to generate infographic curriculums; however, template designs are not limited solely to this purpose.</p>

<p>Once you have logged in with your LinkedIn account or email, you can select a wide range of topics, language maps, timelines, bubble diagrams, tree maps, pictograms, among other formats.</p>

<ol start=""4"">
<li>PiktoChart</li>
</ol>

<p>The portal of Jeff Bullas indicates that this manufacturer of infographics has the ability to remove the graphic designers from the business before we realize it, and that is that PiktoChart is advertised as the tool that allows ""non-designers"" to elaborate infographics in such Just 10 minutes.</p>

<p>This tool has more than 400 totally customizable themes with ready images, objects, graphics as well as colors that you can edit and adjust according to your preferences.</p>",,2018-01-11 05:39:23.117000+00:00,2018-01-12 04:07:28.133000+00:00,United Kingdom,1,0,0,6,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-UT7bHVBnjZU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABo/ybfYfVsI6kQ/photo.jpg?sz=128,http://dreamassignmenthelp.co.uk/

14409,3649042,aspie,"<p>I have been obsessed with computers since I was 3. I am very much a Computer Geek. Unfortunatly I have learning difficulties, one of which is called Dyscalculia. This is a numerical form of Dyslexia, this means I have servere problems with basic maths. I can not divide, subtract, do fractions, meashurents or percentages, and I can not do angles. I have difficulty with addition and multiplication, and I am just getting the the hang of telling the time. I am also Autistic, I had a Diagnosis of Aspergers Syndrome when I 18 but Social services gave me a report last year saying I have Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (besicaly it means they know im autistic but the consultants can not identify the type of autism I have) and to make matters worse I also have Epilepsy. Thankfully I am not Photosensitive. (I don't think I could live with out a computer) I am 26 and I live in my own flat, I have support workers who come around to help me out every day. My ultimate goal in life is be a Hardware Engineer for Microsoft, but having been predicted an F grade in GCSE's for years and than having achieved a low E grade, (mostly through guess work) ,I still don't know how I got an E grade in my GCSE's ? I am currently assesed as being at Entry Level 2 in maths, which means I still have to pass Entry level 2 to get on to Entry Level 3 and then pass Entry Level 3 to get on to Level 1 and then pass Level 1 to get on to Level 2 and then pass Level 2 before I can redo my GCSE's. This sucks big time. I know how to do Algebra, I can explain Parellel Universe Theroy, I can explain string Theroy, I can explain electronics, I can explain a Voltage Triangle, I know the diffrence between ohm's and Farrads, I can tell you which is bigger or smaller between a nano-meter and a atto meter, I know how to build a stirling engine. It sucks that I can not do basic maths with out a calculator. It bugs me to satans stink hole and back that I can not get in to a University because I can not get a GCSE C Grade in maths. I spend so much time on the internet reading about computer science, I am very much a conceptual person, I understand binary, I understand Hexidecimal but when you add basic maths to an equation or fomula it totaly screws with my brain and I will spend like half an hour trying to figure it out before I submit to pulling out the full adder to get a quick awnser, and by than I have forgotten what I was doing espeshaly if it was for a fomula or equation. So basicaly I get pretty desprate as far as trying to learn Computer Science, espeshaly considering so much of it involves mathmatics. I am here to try and learn as much as I can please bear with me if I seem a little off.</p>",,2014-05-18 05:51:30.467000+00:00,2014-05-18 05:51:30.467000+00:00,United Kingdom,1,0,0,7,https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/51d0ca39a02ef2938c05ac9cd8223a84?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1,

Started programming ZX spectrum at 8 when arrived at chritmas with broken cassette :( Messed with some BASIC things on it. Got myself an Amiga (guru_meditation pun) Made some silly AMOS programs, then got a PC did some BASIC QBASIC things.
Went on to do an Electronic engineering degree. Learned Pascal and C there but not properly.
Never really became expert at any of it :(
Then I became a sound engineer and toured around with bands for years and forgot everything!!</p>

<p>Now I have decided to try to be a programmer/ electronic engineer again!!<br>

14631,801667,Weedy101,"<p>I am a landscape designer that is always looking for new design challenges to broaden my horizons. That is why I started to teach myself html and css from all the masses of free resources out there.</p>

<p>My latest project is in HTML5 with CSS3, I am using it to keep my design views open and adaptable. I intend to use it to replace the rather bland and run of the mill templates that all web host's provide for free that I am currently having to use for my business. As a designer paging through what is on offer from host's I get bored very quickly because of the shear lack of individuality, function, and often basic form! So now I am putting my imagination to good use and am determined to beat this if it kills me.</p>

<p>I once went down the Java route, but later realised I should have stuck with C++ (this was in the early 2000's).</p>

<p>I'm currently just completing a web app to help people with content creation and tracking. I chose PHP and Laravel for this project in the hope that it would be the fastest and most stable route for me to ship, which is proving to be the case.</p>
